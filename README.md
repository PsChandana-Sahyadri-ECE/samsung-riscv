<summary><b>Task 3:</b> The goal is to analyze and categorize each of the provided instructions based on their type, whether it be R-type, I-type, or J-type, and then translate them into their respective 32-bit machine instruction codes. These instruction codes should be represented in the appropriate format, ensuring that each instruction is properly encoded according to the specific structure and opcode requirements of the given architecture.

# Understanding RISC-V and Its Instruction Formats

## What is RISC-V?
RISC-V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that enables developers to design processors tailored to specific applications. Based on Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) principles, RISC-V represents the fifth generation of processors built on this concept. Its open and free nature means developers can utilize RISC-V without purchasing licenses, making it a compelling alternative to proprietary processor technologies.

## Instruction Formats in RISC-V
The instruction format of a processor defines how machine language instructions are structured for execution. These instructions are composed of binary data (0s and 1s), each segment providing details about data location and operations to be performed. In RISC-V, there are six primary instruction formats:

1. **R-format**
2. **I-format**
3. **S-format**
4. **B-format**
5. **U-format**
6. **J-format**

| func3      | 3 bits| Specifies the type of operation       |
| rs1        | 5 bits| First source register                 |
| rs2        | 5 bits| Second source register                |
